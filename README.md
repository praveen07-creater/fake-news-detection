# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect whether a news article is **fake or real** using a machine learning model trained on a labeled dataset of real and fake news.

## 💡 Problem Statement
Misinformation and fake news are growing challenges in today’s digital world. This solution uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and ML to automatically detect and classify news articles as real or fake.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- Flask (for deployment)
- Google Colab / VS Code

## 🧠 Model Performance
- **Accuracy:** 98.55%
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score:** Shown in classification report
- **Confusion Matrix:** Also generated
